Surf
====

iOS Minimalist Web Browser App

Surf is a new kind of web browser where you surf the web with just your thumb! Navigation is just swiping and tapping... and you get an awesome rich feed reader that pulls from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Dribbble, DesignerNews, HackerNews, Feedly, Pocket, Instapaper, and Readability.
